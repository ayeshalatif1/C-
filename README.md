Welcome to my C Projects repository! This repository showcases my journey through programming with C and C++ by working on various projects. Below are the details of my first project:

Project 1: Result Card Generator (C)
Overview
The Result Card Generator is a simple console-based program written in C++ that helps users create and manage result cards for students. The program is designed with user interaction and ease of use in mind, featuring multiple options to either enter details or generate result cards.

Features
Main Menu:
Upon launching, the program displays a main screen with two options:

Enter Details: Input student information for generating result cards.
Generate Result Card: Generate result cards based on the entered details.
Input Student Details:
Users can specify the number of students for whom result cards are to be generated. The program collects all the necessary information about each student.

Confirmation Prompt:
After entering all details, the program asks the user whether they want to proceed with generating the result card or cancel the process. Users can confirm by pressing Y or cancel otherwise.

Looping Options:
Once a result card is generated, the program asks the user whether they want to:

Continue generating more result cards.
Exit the program.
